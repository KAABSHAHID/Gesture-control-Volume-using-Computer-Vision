# Gesture-control-Volume-using-Computer-Vision
This project allows users to control the system's volume through hand gestures, using the distance between their thumb and index finger. The system captures hand gestures via a webcam and adjusts the volume in real-time using the Python libraries OpenCV and Mediapipe for hand tracking, and PyCaw to interact with the system's volume settings.
